Nibbleblog-themes
=================

Themes for <a href="https://github.com/dignajar/nibbleblog">Nibbleblog</a> by Syndicatefx, this is a side project done on my free time and sometimes it can take a while to update the themes to work with newer versions of Nibbleblog, or to fix issues. If you find bugs or would like to contribute use the issues and pull requests, thanks!

Themes are also bundled with <a href="https://github.com/dignajar/nibbleblog" target="_blank">Nibbleblog' s official development repo on github</a>, if you choose to download it from there.

You are free to modify, edit and use them in any personal or commercial project without restriction.
